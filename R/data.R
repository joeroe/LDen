#' AZ_A1020_BLM Test Data
#'
#' This data set ontains point location and type data for 358 "diagnostic"
#' surface artifacts from an Ancestral Pueblo site on the
#' Shivwits Plateau in northwestern Arizona. In the Arizona site
#' numbering system, the site number is formally "AZ A:10:20 (BLM)".
#'
#' This is real data, although somewhat simplified here.
#' There are five 'types' (three of them rare), and the two most common
#' 'types' group artifacts that have more detailed identifications
#' ("ceramics" = either painted potsherds or sherds from vessel rims;
#' "stone tool" = any flaked stone tool except for projectile points).
