#' Hodder and Okell's index of association
#' 
#' Calculates Hodder and Okell's (1978) 'A' index of association between two
#' sets of points, which is the product of the ratios of the average distance
#' between points within each set to the average distance the sets.

#' Hodder and Okell's A index of association between `x` and `y`. For the
#' interpretation of this value see Orton (1980, p. 154):
#' "When the distribution of types A and B are randomly mingled, with no
#' association or dissociation, A will have a value of about 1: closely
#' packed but separate distributions have low values of A, and if As and Bs
#' tend to occur together, then A will be greater than 1."
