\title{Local Density Analysis}
\usage{
lda(x, y, type, radius, area = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Equal-length numeric vectors of coordinates}

\item{type}{Vector the same length as \code{x} and \code{y} giving the types or other
categorical variable to construct sets for pairwise comparison.}

\item{radius}{Size of the neighbourhood}

\item{area}{Total area of the window. If \code{NULL}, inferred as the area of the
bounding box of the coordinates specified by \code{x} and \code{y}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the local density coefficients.
}
\description{
\code{lda()} calculates the local density coefficient within and between
all the types in a dataset. The local density coefficient from
Type A to Type B is the mean density of points of Type B within
the specified radius of points of Type A, divided by the global
density of points of Type B (i.e., the number of points of
Type B divided by the total area)

\examples{
lda(AZ_A1020_BLM$x, AZ_A1020_BLM$y, AZ_A1020_BLM$type, radius = 2, area = 2049)
